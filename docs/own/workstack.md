- improve vertex viewer
	- improve camera of 3D view
		- output/xfb view: show frustum (as lines)
		- automatically compute bounds the first time a new
		  command is selected (also determine and fix useW then)
	- show indices in vertex table, correctly index using them
	- allow to select vertices (/indices)
		- in input and output viewer
		- make rows selectable
		- render the select vertex in viewport, e.g. via point pipe
			- later: render the selected triangle?
